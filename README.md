### Greetings! I'm Kabir.

## About Me üëãüèº
Hi there! I'm a student at Cornell University studying CS, Math & Music. I work as a compiler design & computer abstraction researcher at CAPRA; a software developer at Cornell CMSX; and a ML & data analyst at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Much of my work has involved designing databases, APIs and webservers, while I have recently migrated to the wonderful world of programming languages. My current projects focus on developing languages targeted at more niche applications, while exploring how to reverse-engineer previously existing compilation frameworks. I'm also an avid explorer of applied machine learning and algorithm analysis.

Some of my newer projects will include detailed descriptions of my work here, while the inner workings may remain a well-kept secret until fully ready for publication. But feel free to take a look all the same! You can read a bit more about me

## Projects üå±
I'm currently developing a few projects including the following:
- **KLaTsL**: A functional language and typesetter for linear algebra operations. Introduces OCaml-esque notation but with functionality including vector and matrix comprehensions, direct matrix factorizations and more.

- **Franz**: A compiler for representing music through a functional programming language. Introduces features including rhythm comprehensions & motivic pattern matching and compiles directly to ChucK, a language designed for audio output.

- **RISCV-Decompile**: A reverse-engineering decompiler and program verifier to translate between RISC-V Assembly and machine code and to verify that machine code correctly satisfies given program specifications.

- **Flock**: More of a curiosity project than anything ‚Äì designs a series of models and datasets analyzing how to maximize prediction accuracy for different labels in bird data.
