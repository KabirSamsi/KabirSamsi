### Hi there! I'm Kabir.

Feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:samsikabir@gmail.com" target="_blank">samsikabir@gmail.com</a> or <a href="mailto:kas499@cornell.edu" target="_blank">kas499@cornell.edu</a>, or read a bit more about me below!

## Background 👋🏽
I like compilers, machine learning, programming languages, math and other stuff; I also work a fair bith in fullstack development. I'm fond of music, birds, baking and sports of all forms as well. I am:

- 📝 Studying CS & Math, minoring in Music at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) with a concentration in [Programming Languages (PL)](https://pl.cs.cornell.edu/). I graduate in May 2026.

- 🧱 Leading the development of Cornell's course management software with [CMSX](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/cms/cmsx/).

- 🔬 Researching compilers, programming languages and hardware for networking and packet scheduling at [CAPRA](https://github.com/cucapra).

- 👨🏽‍🏫 Putting [fun] in [functional programming at Cornell](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/preface/about.html) (FA23-SP25). Raising critters at Cornell's [Honors DS & OOP course](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2112/2024fa/) (FA25). Teaching people who know much more than I do [how to build great software at Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5150/2025sp/) (SP26).

## Projects 🌱
Check some of my larger public projects on GitHub including <a href="https://github.com/Saberchat/saberchat" target="_blank">Saberchat</a> (platform for schools & community organizations) and <a href="https://github.com/KabirSamsi/find-your-bird/" target="_blank">FindYourBird</a> (ID and information site for amateur birders). At some point I'll get them back on the internet. In my spare time, I like to hack on:

- **[Franz](https://github.com/KabirSamsi/franz/)**: An IR for music notation (my own work, hopefully open-source one day?). Compiles to ChucK, an audio production and representation language.
- **[Calyx](https://github.com/calyxir/calyx)**: An IR for hardware accelerators (open-source contributor). I add optimizations and widgets to the syntax and embedded DSL from time to time.
