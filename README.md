### Hi there! I'm Kabir.

- I study CS, Math & Music at Cornell with a concentration in [Programming Languages](https://pl.cs.cornell.edu/).
- I research the applications \& intersections between programming language theory (PL) and computer architecture at <a href="https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">CAPRA</a>, and work as a software developer at <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/cms/cmsx/" target="_blank">CMSX</a> and a data analyst at <a href="https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/" target="_blank">Merlin</a>.

- My interests lie in PL/compilers, algorithms, software engineering/verificatino and combining them to create elegant systems.

- My background is in fullstack development. Presently, I love exploring programming languages (PL), domain-specific languages (DSLs), and compilation between different languages. I also dabble in algorithm design and software verification. I am always searching new for ways to combine PL, ML & SWE with areas ranging from music to ornithology!

## Projects ðŸŒ±
You can view some of my larger public projects on GitHub including <a href="https://github.com/Saberchat/saberchat" target="_blank">Saberchat</a> (platform for schools & community organizations) and <a href="https://github.com/KabirSamsi/find-your-bird/" target="_blank">FindYourBird</a> (ID and information site for amateur birders). At some point I'll get them back on the internet.

I'm currently working on a few projects including the following!

- **[KLaTsL]([url](https://github.com/KabirSamsi/KLaTsL/))**: A functional, typed & interpreted language focused on linear algebra. Explores liquid typing and the idea of a *dimensional type system*, and presents syntax including matrix comprehensions and typechecked transformations.

- **[Franz]([url](https://github.com/KabirSamsi/franz/))**: A compiled, domain-specific programming language targeted towards compact and modular musical composition, using a medium of text-based musical notation. Compiles to ChucK, an audio production and representation language.
