### Greetings! I'm Kabir.

## About Me
I'm an undergraduate student at Cornell University studying CS, Math and Music, and a research assistant at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Much of work has involved designing databases and webservers that can form an intersection with other areas of my interests, some of which are on display here. 

However, recently my work has shifted more towards interpreter design, programming languages and computer vision, and their applications to areas beyond computer science. In particular, a lot of my current work focuses on its application to improve music development and recognition software.
