### Hi there! I'm Kabir.

## Contact
You can always reach me at [samsikabir@gmail.com](samsikabir@gmail.com) or [kas499@cornell.edu](kas499@cornell.edu)! Also feel free stop by my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kabir-samsi-009248209/]).

## About Me üëãüèº
I study CS, Math & Music at Cornell with a concentration in Programming Languages and Compilers. I am a PL \& compiler abstractions researcher at [CAPRA](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/), a software developer at [CMSX](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/cms/cmsx/) and a data analyst at [Merlin](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/). Much of my work has involved designing databases, APIs and webservers, while I have more recently migrated to working with programming languages \& designing compilers. My current projects focus on developing languages targeted at more niche applications, while exploring how to reverse-engineer previously existing compilers. I also love to explore machine learning and algorithm analysis, with some of my work targeted at designing optimal solutions to related problems.

Some of my newer projects will include detailed descriptions of my work here, while the inner workings may remain a well-kept secret until fully ready for publication. But feel free to take a look all the same!

## Projects üå±
I'm currently working on a few projects including the following! Source code for most will be made available later.
- **KLaTsL**: A functional language and typesetter for linear algebra operations. Introduces OCaml-esque notation but with functionality including vector and matrix comprehensions, direct matrix factorizations and more.

- **Franz**: A compiler for representing music through a functional programming language. Introduces features including rhythm comprehensions & motivic pattern matching and compiles directly to ChucK, a language designed for audio output.

- **RISCV-Decompile**: A reverse-engineering decompiler and program verifier to translate machine code to RISC-V Assembly and verify program correctness.

- **Flock**: More of a curiosity project than anything ‚Äì designs a series of models and datasets analyzing how to maximize prediction accuracy for different labels in bird data.

Do also keep an eye out for some of my notes on algorithmic challenges and ideas I post here!
