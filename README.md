### Hi there! I'm Kabir.

## About Me
I'm an undergraduate student at Cornell University studying CS, Math and Music. Much of my work has been about trying to intersect CS with other disciplines.

I began my formal software engineering journey in Web Development, and as such much of my work has involved designing databases and webservers to assist with areas of my interests â€“ on display here include avian identification software and community intranet networks. However, recently my work has shifted more towards interpreter design, programming languages and computer vision, and their applications to areas beyond computer science.

## Current Interests
My current interests lie primarily in PL theory and computer vision. I'm also continuing my work in improving technology to assist with ornithology, developing faster and more streamlined bird logging tool utilizing the EBird API.
