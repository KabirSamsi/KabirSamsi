### Hi there! I'm Kabir.

## Background
- I am a third-year undergrad studying Computer Science, Mathematics & Music at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) with a concentration in [Programming Languages (PL)](https://pl.cs.cornell.edu/).

- My interests lie in programming languages, compilers, formal verification and turning these into tools for building correct, efficient software. I work heavily within fullstack development, and dabble in algorithms and competitive programming.

- I am a strong believer that CS is at its best when used hand-in-hand with other areas. I am always searching new for ways to integrate fields ranging from [music](https://github.com/KabirSamsi/franz) to [ornithology](https://github.com/KabirSamsi/find-your-bird)!

## Experience
- I research programming language \& compiler design, formal verification computer architecture abstractions \& packet scheduling at <a href="https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">CAPRA</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) and [Anshuman Mohan](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~amohan/).

- I am a core software engineer and full-stack developer on Cornell's <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/cms/cmsx/" target="_blank">CMSX</a> research \& project team, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Andrew Myers](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/).

- I have spent two years as Head Teaching Assistant of Cornell's [foundational course](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/intro/3110.html) in functional programming, theoretical CS and advanced data structures. I priorly taught and assisted teaching at number of organizations and courses.

- I worked for two years as a data analyst \& software engineer at the <a href="https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/" target="_blank">Cornell Lab Of Ornithology</a>, on the Merlin project.

## Projects ðŸŒ±
You can view some of my larger public projects on GitHub including <a href="https://github.com/Saberchat/saberchat" target="_blank">Saberchat</a> (platform for schools & community organizations) and <a href="https://github.com/KabirSamsi/find-your-bird/" target="_blank">FindYourBird</a> (ID and information site for amateur birders). At some point I'll get them back on the internet.

I'm currently working on a few projects including the following!

- **[Franz]([url](https://github.com/KabirSamsi/franz/))**: A compiled, domain-specific programming language targeted towards compact and modular musical composition, using a medium of text-based musical notation. Compiles to ChucK, an audio production and representation language.

- **[KLaTsL]([url](https://github.com/KabirSamsi/KLaTsL/))**: A type system linear algebra. Explores liquid typing and the idea of a *dimensional type system*, and presents syntax including matrix comprehensions and typechecked transformations. **(stale presently)**
