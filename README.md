### Greetings! I'm Kabir.

## About Me
I'm an undergraduate student at Cornell University studying CS, Math and Music, and a research assistant at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

Much of work has involved designing databases and webservers that can form an intersection with other areas of my interests, some of which are on display here. However, recently my work has shifted more towards interpreter design, programming languages and computer vision, and their applications to areas beyond computer science.

## Current Interests
My current interests lie primarily in PL theory and computer vision, and in particular application to improved music development and recognition software. I am also working on developing improved software to track and log bird sightings.
