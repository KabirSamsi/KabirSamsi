### Hi there! I'm Kabir.

I study CS, Math & Music at Cornell with a concentration in Programming Languages and Compilers. I research the applications \& intersections between programming language theory and processor design at <a href="https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">CAPRA</a>, and work as a software developer at <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/cms/cmsx/" target="_blank">CMSX</a> and a data analyst at <a href="https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/" target="_blank">Merlin</a>. My interests lie in programming language theory & compilers, applied machine learning, algorithms and combining them all within software engineering to create elegant software systems. While my background skills lie in full-stack development, I have recently developed a passion for developing domain-specific languages targeted at more niche applications, and exploring compilation and assembly between different frameworks. I also love to explore machine learning and algorithm design, and my biggest overall goal is using my passions to develop new, elegant software systems.

I'm currently learning more about deep learning and PyTorch, as well as designing more complex interpreters with Rust!

## Tools & Technologies ðŸ”§
  ### Languages
  JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Python, C, C++, Rust, OCaml, Haskell, C#, Ruby, Swift, Assembly (RISC-V, x86) HTML, CSS

### Frameworks/Tools
  - **Web Development**: MEAN Stack, React, Ajax, JQuery, JSP/EJS/Pug, Bootstrap, Mongoose, Nginx
  - **Machine Learning**: Flask, Pandas, Numpy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
  - **Databases**: MongoDB, SQL/PostgreSQL/MariaDB, Neo4j, AWS Lambda
  - **Other**: LaTeX, Git, Coq

## Projects ðŸŒ±
You can view some of my larger, open projects on GitHub including <a href="https://github.com/Saberchat/saberchat" target="_blank">Saberchat</a> (platform for schools & community organizations) and <a href="https://github.com/KabirSamsi/find-your-bird/" target="_blank">FindYourBird</a> (ID and information site for amateur birders).

I'm currently working on a few projects including the following!

- **KLaTsL**: A functional, typed & interpreted language focused on linear algebra. Introduces an elegant type system and syntax featuring matrix comprehensions & factorizations, typed transformations, dimensional typing and more.

- **Franz**: A compiled programming language to represent music, Franz introduces features including rhythm comprehensions, recursive scales \& motivic pattern matching. Compiles to ChucK, an audio production and representation language.

- **RISCV-Disassemble**: A disassembler, decompiler, processor simulator and program verifier to translate machine code to RISC-V Assembly and verify program correctness given a set of program-state specifications.

- **Flock**: More of a curiosity project than anything â€“ a series of models and datasets analyzing how to maximize prediction accuracy for different labels in bird data, and discover new cluster patterns across species.

Do also keep an eye out for some of my notes on algorithmic challenges and ideas I post here!
